# NFTRental Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

NFT Rentals is just like any other rental service. If you need a car for a few days, it’s more cost effective to rent one than to buy a new one. The same goes for renting an NFT for a short amount of time. Just make sure you return it on time!

Why NFT renting is important?
NFTs can have a lot of different uses. NFT renting is a good way to get started with this kind of asset. This is important because more and more people are getting interested in NFTs, and this industry makes it easier for them to try them out.

NFT rentals benefit both owners and renters by allowing renters to use NFTs they might not be able to afford and giving owners a way to monetize their NFTs.

The NFT rental standard: ERC-4907
The NFT rental marketplace Double Protocol is credited for submitting the rentable NFT standard “EIP-4907,” which passed the final review by the Ethereum development team on June 28 and became the 30th ERC standard.
